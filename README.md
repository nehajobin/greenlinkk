Project Description

GreenLink is a student-driven sustainability platform that measures, ranks, and improves environmental responsibility across college campuses. It allows students and authorities to track eco-friendly initiatives, share updates, and compete to make their campus the greenest, promoting transparency and measurable impact.

Problem Statement

Many college campuses claim to support sustainability, but there is no transparent, measurable, and student-driven system to track environmental initiatives.
As a result:

Sustainability efforts are often performative rather than accountable

Students have little visibility into campus environmental impact

Colleges lack motivation to improve beyond superficial measures

GreenLink solves this by creating a centralized, measurable, and competitive platform for campuses to track, share, and improve their green initiatives.

Solution

GreenLink provides a student-driven, transparent platform:

Campus Dashboard – Shows each college’s eco-friendly initiatives, scores, and progress

Leaderboard – Ranks colleges based on measurable environmental impact, encouraging healthy competition

Initiatives & Posts – Students and authorities can submit, share, and showcase campus projects. Others can react, comment, and contribute

Scoring System – Tracks metrics like energy efficiency, waste reduction, water conservation, and carbon footprint to calculate a fair “GreenScore”

Donations & Events – Colleges can request funding for sustainability projects, and students can join local or global environmental events

Role-based Access – Students, authorities, and admins have tailored views for submitting data, moderating content, and managing initiatives
